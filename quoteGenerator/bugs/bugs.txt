I set up the angular site and the index, but 
text is not generating, even though the controler has been imported
-i did ng-click="quote.generate" withtout the generate(), which means that the function was never callled

2. object of not defined, the problem here was that i was 
generating a floating point number and not an integer

3. This is why I was running into issues
