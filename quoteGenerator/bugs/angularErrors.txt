1. I was getting lots of errors with, assigning and change variables such as
-cannot assign to read only 
-interpolation error 
-Not an object, the best way to resolve all of these 
errors for me was to stay consistent with $scope and this

Just use and change $scope, also set values for $scope within the 
local function calls


 21       //this.text = $scope.quote;
 22       //this.author = "Chuck Norris";

This for example broke, so i just used scope to stay consistent
